## Battle Ship Game

### Game play

Player one and player two places 'n' ships on a grid. Player one has to guess where player two might have kept his ships and fire missile on them. This is repeated by player two as well and they do it alternatively. There is no limit to the number of fires. Whoever destroys all the ships of other players first, he wins.
